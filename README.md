<h1>Truss Optimization using Bayesian Optimization and Machine Learning</h1>

<!-- Badges here -->

<p>This project, led by Frans van der Meer, focuses on optimizing truss structures using Bayesian optimization and machine learning techniques. The goal is to minimize the weight of the structure while satisfying structural requirements, potentially including additional objectives such as minimizing waste in reusing components.</p>

<h3>1. Defining the Optimization Problem</h3>
<p>The project aims to find an optimal truss design by optimizing nodal coordinates and cross-sectional properties. The main objective is to minimize the total weight while adhering to structural requirements, such as specific natural frequencies.</p>

<h3>2. Optimization Process</h3>
<p>The optimization process involves embedding a Python finite element solver within a Bayesian optimization algorithm. This combines weight minimization with structural performance requirements into a single objective function suited for Bayesian optimization.</p>

<h4>2.1 Adjusting Parameters</h4>
<p>Parameters of the truss design and the optimization algorithm can be adjusted to explore the balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to an optimal solution.</p>

<h4>2.2 Visualization and Analysis</h4>
<p>The project includes methods for visualizing and analyzing the optimized truss designs and the effectiveness of the Bayesian optimization process.</p>
