Commit 1 - W1 Jan2024
I created a new notebook called TRUSS1 where I have been doing my work.
I somewhat have created a function to process data to arrays to train the optimiser which also has a writing function.
I also managed to start the optimiser but many things remain such as fixing the correct cross section - connectivity issues

Commit 2 - W2 Jan2024
Got the optimiser to start solving by using and saving the geom files. Currently there remain dimensionality issues in calculating the expected improvement when sampling multiple times. There also remains to add optimised search not just exploratory.
